# Tritreeeee

*(With 5 × e)*

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It allows to display and edit "Tritrees" as inspired by [Jeff
aka @ippsketch's Tweet](https://twitter.com/ippsketch/status/1414947706968199170/photo/2).

[You can find it running here](https://bxt.github.io/tritreeeee/).

## Developing

This is a web site that uses web technologies like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

To get started run

```bash
npm install
```

Developing works best if you use an IDE with TypeScript and ESLint support built in. Then just start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Before committing, you should run the linters, just in case you missed something:

```bash
npm run lint
```

In the end you can build and export all the required files to the `out` directory using:

```bash
npm run build
```

That's it!

There are some GitHub actions to lint and build the app, as well as deploy the `main` branch to GitHub pages at <https://bxt.github.io/tritreeeee/>.
